RuntimeError: This function was deprecated since version 1.9 and is now removed. `torch.solve` is deprecated in favor of `torch.linalg.solve`. `torch.linalg.solve` has its arguments reversed and does not return the LU factorization.
To get the LU factorization see `torch.lu`, which can be used with `torch.lu_solve` or `torch.lu_unpack`.
X = torch.solve(B, A).solution should be replaced with:
X = torch.linalg.solve(A, B)
